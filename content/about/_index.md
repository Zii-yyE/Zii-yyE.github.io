# Welcome!

I am Ziye Wang (pronounced as "Z yeah wan"), a fourth-year undergraduate at Peking University majoring in Bioinformatics and Mathematics.

## Education

Still far from educated.

## Research Interest

I am broadly interested in the intersecion of biology and mathematics. But my main focus is on **[population genetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_genetics)** and **[phylogenetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetics)**, where the two [seemingly distant fields of biology and mathematics](https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2014/12/30/the-two-cultures-of-mathematics-and-biology/) get along pretty well.

I am particularly excited about developing computational tools that can infer the evolutionary history. The philosophy behind this aligns with William Faulkner's quote, "**The past is never dead. It's not even past**". The way everything looks like now are all shaped by what came before. And therefore we should be able to learn something about the past from the present.





## Hobbies

My hobbies change in a birth-death process fashion. Currently alive ones are:

### Piano

This is the longest-lived. I've been playing the piano for 15 years non-stop (defined by touching it at least once per year). Nevertheless, my skill barely improved after the first 7 or 8 years, due to lack of rigorous training, lack of flair, plus an abundance of laziness. The good news is I still enjoy playing it.  

There are several pianists/composers whose pieces I like so much that I searched for the sheet music and tried playing them myself. These include:

#### Jarrod Radnich
- One can find videos of him playing on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrR9q7XWIqB5LhazlKYi-Og)
- For a more complete list of his works (audio only), see [Reverbnation](https://www.reverbnation.com/jarrodradnich)
- Sheet music is available at [Musicnotes](https://my.musicnotes.com/search?search=radnich&page=1)
- My favorites are his arrangements of  [Pirates of the Caribbean](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4JD-3-UAzM) and [Bohemian Rhapsody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgR3WiGPYiQ)


#### Claude Debussy

#### Bill Evans


### Alumini
